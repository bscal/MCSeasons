## MCSeasons
Minecraft 1.18 Fabric mod that add seasons to the game.

## Gameplay
Seasons are tied to minecraft time. Different seasons types per biome.
Default is 4 seasons per year (Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter). 
Values are customizable.

More too come.

## Usage
TODO

### Developer
I documented much yet but if you look at SeasonAPI class you can see most functionality.

Some notes:
* Seasons are based on only the Overworld
* Seasons are tracked by an internal id.
* See SeasonTypes for see possible types of seasons
* Seasons are based on biome, however by default biomes will use 4 seasons per year
* Time is tracked server side and is synced to clients
